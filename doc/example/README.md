This directory contains three examples of using moments++, with increasing degrees of complexity:

## test\_run
Predictions under a pure two-locus model of a four-epoch demography and linked selection.
Parameters are specified in the augmented demes file 'test\model.yaml'

## two-locus time
Contains an Rmd script detailing the creation of augmented demes files, running moments++, assembling the predictions into a tiny lookup table and plotting the results.

## fake\_chromosome
TODO
