#### Diversity at center of 100kb region

The `fwdpy11` script, `simulate_recomb_region.py` computes steady state
diversity, averaged over many replicates, in the center of a 100kb region.

#### Diversity under a human-like genome parameters

The script `simulate_chromosome.py` allows for variable recombination rate,
using the 1000 genomes YRI recombination map, exon regions specified by a bed
file, and a DFE from Kim et al. (2017). Diversity is measured every 1000 bp,
and averaged over many replicate samples.
